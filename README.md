<h1 align="center"> BrainFuck Programming Tutorial</h1>

<h6 align="center">by Katie</h6>

## INTRODUCTION

**Brainfuck** is probably the craziest language I have ever had the pleasure of coming across. And, yes, there are quite a few tutorials that you will find on google about the language and how to program in it, but I am writing this one as most of them that you will find seem to only cover just the basics of using the operators.

Brainfuck, language itself, is a _Turing-complete language_ created by Urban MÃ¼ller. The language only consists of 8 operators, `< > + - [ ] , .` yet with the 8 operators, you are capable of writing almost any program you can think of.

To write programs in brainfuck, I would suggest you get a few things first.

First of all you will need an interpreter or a compiler. An experienced programmer could easily write one quite quickly after reading this. If you don't quite know how to write one. I have included the source to a Brainfuck-to-C interpreter that I wrote in C as well as one that I wrote in BrainFuck itself. Also I have included the source for the worlds smallest Compiler (171 bytes) written in x86 assembly by Brian Raiter. You'll find all those in the last section of this tutorial.

Next, I would suggest an ASCII chart with all the characters and their decimal equivalent value.

Next on the items is would be a calculator. Any will do. It will help you figure out the Greatest Common Factors for use in incrementing a memory block quickly.

Lastly, I would recommend having no life and lots of time on your hands to actually want to sit and write programs in this amazingly inefficient language. I promise you, if you take the time to sit and write a program in brainfuck for an hour or five, you will definitely see why it deserves its name.

## BASICS

The idea behind brainfuck is memory manipulation. Basically you are given an array of 30,000 1 byte memory blocks. The array size is actually dependent upon the implementation used in the compiler or interpretor, but standard brainfuck states 30,000. Within this array, you can increase the memory pointer, increase the value at the memory pointer, etc. Let me first present to you the 8 operators available to us.

```txt
> = increases memory pointer (moves the pointer to the right 1 block)
< = decreases memory pointer (moves the pointer to the left 1 block)
+ = increases value stored at current memory block by 1
- = decreases value stored at current memory block by 1
[ = starts a loop if the value stored at current memory block is not zero
] = jumps back to corresponding [ if the value stored at current memory block is not zero
, = inputs 1 character to current memory block
. = prints 1 character at current memory block to the console
```

- Any arbitrary character besides the 8 listed above should be ignored by the compiler or interpretor. Characters besides the 8 operators should be considered comments.

- All memory blocks on the "array" are set to zero at the beginning of the program. And the memory pointer starts out on the very left most memory block.

- Loops may be nested as many times as you want. But all `[` must have a corresponding `]`.

## EXAMPLES

The simplest program in brainfuck is:

```bf
[-]
```

Well, that's what they say anyway, but I hardly consider that a program. All it does is enter a loop that decreases the value stored at the current memory block until it reaches zero, then exits the loop. But since all memory blocks start out at zero, it will never enter that loop.

So lets write a real program.

```bf
+++++[-]
```

This is equivalent in C to:

```c
*p = +5;
while (*p != 0) {
	*p--;
}
```

In that program we are incrementing the current memory pointers value to 5, then entering a loop that decreases the value located at the memory pointer till it is zero, then exits the loop.

```bf
>>>>++
```

This will move the memory pointer to the fourth memory block, and increment the value stored there by 2. So it looks like

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[0] [0] [0] [2] [0] [0]...
             ^
       memory pointer
```

As you can see in the 'k-rad' ASCII diagram, our memory pointer points to the fourth memory block, and it incremented the value there by 2. since there was nothing there before, it now contains the value: 2. If we take that same program, and add more onto the end of it like:

```bf
>>>>++<<+>>+
```

At the end of our program, our memory layout will look like this:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[0] [1] [0] [3] [0] [0]...
             ^
       memory pointer
```

The pointer was moved to the fourth block, incremented the value by 2, moved back 2 blocks to the second block, incremented the valued stored there by 1, and then the pointer moved 2 blocks to the right again to the fourth block and incremented the value stored there by one. And at the end of the program the memory pointer lies back on the fourth memory block. That is fine and dandy, but we can't really see anything. So lets write a program that will produce actual output.

When cavemen started scrawling shit on the walls, the first ever picture drawn was a man waving at a picture of the planet earth. I am not about to break that trend. so I present "Hello World!" in brainfuck.

```bf
>+++++++++[<++++++++>-]<.>+++++++[<++++>-]<+.+++++++..+++.[-]
>++++++++[<++++>-] <.>+++++++++++[<++++++++>-]<-.--------.+++
.------.--------.[-]>++++++++[<++++>- ]<+.[-]++++++++++.
```

We must remember that we are working with numbers, so we must use a character's ASCII decimal number to represent it. then when we print it, will print the value as an ASCII character. Lets break this program down.

```bf
>+++++++++[<++++++++>-]<.
```

Lets break this part down farther using our diagrams.

```bf
>
```

First you can see, that we increment the memory pointer to the next memory block leaving the first memory block at zero.

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
     ^
memory pointer
```

We then increase the value at our current memory block to 9.

```bf
+++++++++
```

Leaving our diagram like this:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[0] [9] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
     ^
memory pointer
```

Since the block we are on contains a non-zero value, we then enter the loop.

```bf
[
```

Now that we are in the loop. Then we move the memory pointer one block to the left

```bf
<
```

Which gives us:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[0] [9] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
 ^
memory pointer
```

And we increment the memory blocks stored value by 8.

```bf
++++++++
```

So our diagram looks like:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[8] [9] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
 ^
memory pointer
```

Then we move the memory pointer one block to the right, to the second memory block again, and decrease the value stored there from 9 to 8.

```bf
>-
```

Diagram:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[8] [8] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
     ^
memory pointer
```

We then hit the end of our loop.

```bf
]
```

The program checks to see if the memory block the pointer currently points to contains the value zero, but current memory block's stored value is not zero, so the loop starts over. Moving the pointer to the left--Increasing it by 8--moving the pointer to the right--decreasing it by 1. After the 2nd pass of all that, our diagram now looks like:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[16] [7] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
      ^
memory pointer
```

It will continue this process over and over until the value stored at the second memory block is zero. It then exits the loop. Once we have exited the loop. The program moves the pointer back to the first memory block one final time, and prints the value stored there.

```bf
<.
```

And the diagram:

```txt
memory blocks
-------------
[72] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
 ^
memory pointer
```

If you followed that, you would see that we increased the first memory blocks stored value by 8, 9 times. We know that `8 x 9 = 72` and 72 is the ASCII decimal value for 'H'.

Wow...that was a lot of freaking work just to print one single character. Why you may ask would you want to waste your time programming is this horribly inefficient programming language?!? Well, because some of us hackers actually like to do fun and challenging things to expand our minds and make us think. Anyways, carrying on...

If we were to write that in C, it would be like:

```c
++p;
*p=+9;
while(*p != 0) {
	--p;
	*p=+8;
	--p;
	--*p;
}
--p;
putchar(*p);
```

I'm going to leave it up to you to figure out how the rest of that is printing out "Hello World!" But from that you should have the basics of memory pointer and value manipulation.

## INPUT

Input in brainfuck is controlled by the `,` operator. It will get a character and store its ASCII decimal value to the current memory block that the memory pointer points to. Lets experiment with it a bit.

Remember, when you use the input operator, you are actually storing the decimal ASCII value of the character you press on the keyboard. So pressing 2 for input isn't actually storing 2. Its storing the decimal value of the ASCII char '2', which is decimal 50.

```bf
,.,.,.
```

This will take in 3 characters and print them out. Lets write something more complex.

```bf
>,[>,]<[<]>[.>]
```

This is a program that will act like the UNIX cat command. It will read in from STDIN and output to STDOUT. Lets break it down.

```bf
>,
```

Move the memory pointer the the second memory block leaving the first block with a value of zero. Input a value and store it at the current memory pointer location which is the second memory block.

```bf
[>,]
```

Begin a loop that will move the pointer up a memory block, and Input a value and store it there. This will repeat until it encounters a NULL character (\0 or decimal value of zero);

```bf
<[<]
```

Rewind. Once we've made it to this point in the program, it means that we have encountered a NULL character. So in order to start our loop, we need to move the memory pointer one memory block backwards so that we have a non-zero value stored there. Once there, the loop starts, and moves the memory pointer one block to the left until we reach the first memory block, which we left with a value of zero at the beginning of the program. Once it reaches the first memory block with the value of zero, the loop exits.

```bf
>[.>]
```

Now we mover our memory pointer to the right one space, so we are now on a memory block containing a non-zero value. We enter a loop and proceed to print the current value stored, then move the memory pointer to the right. We continue to do this until we come to a memory block containing a NULL character (zero) and then the loop exits.

This program in C would be like:

```c
++p;
*p = getchar();
while (*p != 0) {
	++p;
	*p = getchar();
}
--p;
while (*p != 0) --p;
++p;
while (*p != 0) {
	putchar(*p);
	++p;
}
```

Now that we are able to input/output and manipulate our memory, there is already a wealth of programs you could write.

## TRICKS

There are many little tricks you can use in brainfuck to make it easier. I will try to cover ones I have figure out.

### How to move or shift a value from one memory block to another

```bf
+++++[>>+<<-]
```

This will set the first memory block to the value of 5. It then starts a loop that will copy the value stored in the first block, to the third memory block. Leaving the first memory block empty again.

### How to copy from one memory block to another

```bf
+++++[>>+>+<<<-]>>>[<<<+>>>-]
```

This little program sets the first memory block to the value of 5. Then it goes and copies that value to the 3rd memory block and 4th memory block, leaving the first memory block empty. It then moves the value from the 4th memory block back to the first one, leaving the 4th memory block empty.

### Addition of 2 memory blocks can easily be done as well

```bf
+++++>+++[<+>-]
```

We increment the first block to 5. Move the pointer the the right one block, and then increment that block by three. We want to add the second memory block to the first one. So we enter a loop that will move the pointer to the left one block, add one, then move it to the right 1 block and subtract one.

### Subtraction of one block from another is just as easy

```bf
+++++++>+++++[<-
```

We increment the first block to 7, move to the right one block, increment it by 5, then we begin a loop that will move the pointer to the left and subtract one then move the pointer back to the right and decrease the value stored there. Doing this until we have subtracted 5 from 7.

### Multiplication of blocks

We have covered before in our "Hello, World!" program, but I will go over it again right here.

```bf
+++[>+++++<-]
```

We just incremented the first blocks value to 3, then started a loop that will move the pointer to the right one block, add 5, then move the pointer back to the left one block and subtract one. This will accomplish multiplying 5 by 3 and leave the value stored at the second memory block at 15.

### Division is the same, but we subtract instead

### if-statements

if-statements took a while for me to get the hang of, but after a while they finally just clicked for me. Basically if you think about it, an if statement is just testing whether a condition is `true` or `false`. That is to say zero or non-zero. So I will try to show them the best I can, as conditional statements in brainfuck seem to be one of the less documented things about the language.

Say we want to input into memory block 1. Then we would like to test if the input value (x) was equal to 5, and if so, set y to 3. There are two ways to do this, one is the destructive flow control, where it diminishes the value you are testing. The other obviously non-destructive flow control. where your variable stays intact.

Here the is non destructive:

in C:

```c
x = getchar;
if (x == 5) {
	y = 3;
}
```

in BrainFuck:

```bf
,[>>+>+<<<-]>>>[<<<+>>>-]>+<<[-----[>]>>[<<<+++>>>[-]]
```

Once again, lets break that down to hopefully explain that better. I will run though this twice. Once as we go along assuming the value 6 was entered, and once assuming the value 5 was entered. Also, remember, brainfuck will _only_ enter a loop if the value in the current memory block is non-zero. If the value at the block is zero, then it will skip over that loop and ignore it. And the same goes while in a loop. If when it reaches the other end of that loop `]`, if the value stored at the block where the pointer is currently at is zero, it will exit the loop and continue on with the program.

input into x.

```bf
,
```

```txt
 1   2   3   4   5   6
[x] [y] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
 ^
memory pointer
```

copy from block 1, to block 3, using block 4 as a temp storage. We end on block number 4.

```bf
[>>+>+<<<-]>>>[<<<+>>>-]
```

```txt
 1   2   3   4   5   6
[x] [y] [x] [0] [0] [0]...
             ^
       memory pointer
```

set block 5 to 1. This will be our block to test for true of false. Then move the pointer back to 3.

```bf
>+<<
```

```txt
 1   2   3   4   5   6
[x] [y] [x] [0] [1] [0]
         ^
   memory pointer
```

Now subtract 5 and if x was 5, set y to 3 and then move the pointer back over to block 5 and set back to zero so that the loop will only run once. If x was not equal to 5, then the pointer will end up resting on memory block 6.

```bf
[-----[>]>>[<<<+++>>>[-]]
```

if x was 5:

```txt
 1   2   3   4   5   6
[x] [3] [0] [0] [0] [0]...
                 ^
           memory pointer
```

if x was not 5

```txt
 1   2   3   4   5   6
[x] [y] [x] [0] [1] [0]...
                     ^
               memory pointer
```

That was the non destructive way to do an if statement. The destructive way would be to just subtract from the input variable directly instead of copying it. this will lead to much shorter code. Lets test x for the value 5 again and set y to 3 if it is.

Destructive way:

```bf
> > +[<<,-----[>]>>[<<+++>>[-]]]
```

Well I hope you enjoyed learning how to program in brainfuck as much as I did. Thats all I have to write about for now. Maybe I'll write another paper later on with more advanced techniques as I figure them out. Until then, here are some challenges to give you something to program in brainfuck:

1. Write a program to print your name.

2. Write a program to print all printable ASCII characters.

3. (From BrainFuck Golf) Write a program that will take a NULL ('\0') terminated string as input, and output source code for a BrainFuck program that when compiled and ran, will print the string input into the first program. (yes, this sounds like a doozy, but I've actually done this in 1 of code).
